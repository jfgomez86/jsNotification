jsNotification
==============

A simple themed notification widget, written purely in javascript, fully
customizable.

Usage
=====

Include jsNotification.js in your project, then call:

  Notification.send({message: "Hello World"});

The options object can be customized as follows:

  theme    -- The theme to use for the notification (default is 'default').
  duration -- The duration in miliseconds that the widget will be displayed.
  onStart  -- Callback run before the notification is actually displayed but
              just after creating the dom node (it's still not in the document).
  onEnd    -- Callback run just before removing the notification element.

  NOTE: Both callbacks receive the notification dom node as an argument.

Themeing
========

The 'default' theme consists of a set of css rules written in JavaScript:

  Notification.themes = {
    'default': {
      position: 'fixed',
      'top': '-1px',
      border: '1px solid #000',
      padding: '5px',
      margin: '0 auto',
      width: '90%',
      height: '12px',
      paddingTop: '5px',
      background: '#FFEFC6',
      fontSize: '15px',
      textAlign: 'center'
    },
  }

In order to create a new theme you'll have to do something like this:

  Notification.themes['your-theme-name'] = {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 'something',
    ...
  }

All notifications will be centered horizontally. There is currently no way to
change this.
